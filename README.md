# WeeklyStatusReportFiller
_An attempt to more easily fill out Weekly Status Reports that my supervisor has requested._

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:
Every week I am supposed to email my supervisor a "Weekly Status Report" which includes a breakdown of what I've done each day. I usually have kept a .txt file on my Desktop and filled it out at the end of every day throughout the week. As I open the file, make sure the formatting is right, look up the dates of this week, and so on, I have thought, "This stuff could be (mostly) automated, especially since I am in the BASH shell environment throughout the workday anyways." 

The goal of my program is to be able to execute a command with a string (kind of like the `git commit -m` command) and have it fill out my form with the correct dates automatically. Then when the end of the week is reached, I will issue a command to email the text to my supervisor. Thus saving my a precious couple of minutes throghout the week....
